For your backend setup using Strapi with Docker, MongoDB, and Stripe for payment processing, your `README.md` should cover several key areas including setup instructions, environment variables configuration, Docker commands, Strapi specifics, and information about integrating Stripe for payments. Here's an example structure for your `README.md`:

# Backend for Restaurant Ordering System

This document provides the setup and usage instructions for the backend of a Restaurant Ordering System. The backend is built with Strapi, uses MongoDB for data storage, and integrates Stripe for processing payments.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Stripe account for payments processing

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   Clone the backend repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Environment Variables:**
   Create an `.env` file at the root of your project and fill in the required environment variables as per the `.env.example` template provided. Important variables include:
   - `DATABASE_CLIENT`
   - `DATABASE_NAME`
   - `DATABASE_HOST`
   - `DATABASE_PORT`
   - `DATABASE_USERNAME`
   - `DATABASE_PASSWORD`
   - `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME`
   - `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD`
   - Stripe keys.

3. **Docker Compose:**
   Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the Strapi and MongoDB services in detached mode.

4. **Access Strapi:**
   Once the containers are up, access the Strapi admin panel by navigating to `http://localhost:1337/admin` in your browser. Complete the setup by creating an admin user.

5. **Create Entities:**
   Manually create the `Orders`, `Restaurants`, `Users`, and `Dishes` entities within the Strapi admin panel. Configure the relationships as required, for example, a one-to-many relationship between `Restaurants` and `Dishes`.

6. **Stripe Integration:**
   Use the provided `order.js` controller for handling order creation and payment processing with Stripe. Ensure your Stripe secret key is correctly configured in the controller.

## Docker Commands

- `docker-compose up -d` to start the services.
- `docker-compose down` to stop the services.
- `docker-compose logs` to view the logs of the services.

## Strapi Configuration

- **Access Control:** Ensure to configure the permissions for the `Orders`, `Restaurants`, `Users`, and `Dishes` entities to control access as needed.
- **Custom Controllers:** The `order.js` controller is a custom controller for processing orders. Review and customize it according to your requirements.Once your strapi server is generated you will need to add order.js to the controllers folder of your order entity.

## Stripe Payment Processing

- The order processing integrates Stripe for payments. The `create` function within `order.js` handles the creation of charges and records the order details in the database. Make sure you add your stripe private key.

## Notes

- This setup assumes familiarity with Docker, Strapi, and Stripe. Consult the official documentation of each for more detailed information.
- The `.env` file contains sensitive information and should not be committed to version control.

## Contributing

Contributions to the backend setup or documentation are welcome. Please follow the project's contribution guidelines and submit pull requests for review.
